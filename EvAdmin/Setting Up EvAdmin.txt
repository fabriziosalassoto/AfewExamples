Setting up to use EvAdmin:
==============================================================
This is a program that was never put into production, written
in 2009. I've brought it up to date, and will continue to test
and clean it up. I don't fully remember how it works, but it
processed order requests and authorizations produced from web
pages (not included) and works with everal tables in an "eva"
database.

In the file EvAdmin\rsc\EvAdmin.rsc:

Resource 202 is the iupaddress/domain name for the MySQL server.
203 is the data base name "eva". There is also this name 
hard-coded in the program I think.

Resource MLTEXT 102 is the login dialog and has the default 
user name and password.

Once you start the program and Logon is successful,
Select Utilities from the Task menu,
Click the "Enable Dangerous Operations" button,
Click the "Create DAtabase" button,
Click the "Enable Dangerous Operations" button,
click the "Restore Database" button,
Click the "Enable Dangerous Operations" button,
click the Load Orders Log" button,
and then select the "Products" page from the Tasks menu.


Most of the database code is in CTDQueryPage.cpp. Each actual page 
is essentially table driven. Extensive use is made of DataGrid
controls. Actual database operations are provided by the toolkit's
dbasesvc module.
